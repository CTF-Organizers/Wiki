This page lists companies willing to sponsor CTF competitions, the requirements for receiving it, and how to contact them.

## Amazon Web Services

*AWS has been a sponsor of a number of CTFs. To request credits for a CTF use the form at https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/ and select "Computer Science Security" for the Area of Study. Make sure you're aware of the timeline/deadlines published at https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/faq/#element-7d1ad18f-a7d5-4cc2-b7fa-88100efdff03 as there is significant lead-time for credits.
If your CTF schedule does not work with such a lead time, you can try emailing aws-security@amazon.com to get an expedited response.*

## Google Cloud Platform

*We are currently working on creating a form to process sponsorship submissions. Contact google-ctf@google.com in the meantime.*.

## Digital Ocean
*Please submit your information through our request form **[here](https://goo.gl/forms/o3lArqe60vfnly3A2)**. Your request will be assessed by someone from the DigitalOcean Community Team in the order that it is received. Please allow up to three weeks for proper review and consideration before you hear back from someone from our team. **We kindly ask that you refrain from submitting multiple inquiries for the same sponsorship.***
